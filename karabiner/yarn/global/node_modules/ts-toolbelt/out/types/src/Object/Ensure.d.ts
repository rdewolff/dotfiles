 * Sometimes, we can end up with mixed up **`objects`** that do not make sense
 * visually (or that could at least be simplified for the end user). This will
 * turn anything that is passed to it into a cleaned up **`object`**.
 *
 * If **`O`** has been mixed up with a **Tuple**, then only its own keys will be
 * kept. However, if it's only an **`Array`** or a mix of it, we restore it. And
 * **`object`**s that were mixed with **`Array`**s cannot be untangled.
 * @param O
 * @returns **`object`**
 * @example
 * ```ts
